Feature Engineering:

Injury and Suspension Data: Players who are injured or suspended should be given a significantly lower recommendation score or even excluded from the recommendations.
Player Price and Ownership: Consider the player's price and ownership percentage. A high-performing player who is less owned can be a differential pick, providing an edge in mini-leagues.
Positional Weighting: Different positions (e.g., defenders, midfielders, forwards) might have different scoring patterns. We can adjust weights based on positions.
Home vs. Away Performance: Some players perform better at home than away, and vice versa. This can be factored into the recommendation.
Team's Upcoming Fixtures: If a team has a run of easy fixtures, their players might be more valuable in the short term.
Advanced Modeling:

Machine Learning: Instead of a weighted scoring system, use machine learning models like regression, decision trees, or even neural networks to predict future performance based on historical data.
Time Series Analysis: Player performance is a time series data. Techniques like ARIMA or Prophet can be used to forecast player scores.
Clustering: Group players with similar performance patterns. This can help in identifying undervalued players.
Sentiment Analysis:

As previously discussed, analyze sentiments from news articles, tweets, or forums about a player. Positive sentiment can indicate a player is in good form or has a favorable upcoming fixture.
User Preferences:

Allow users to set their preferences. For example, if a user wants to take more risks, recommend differential picks. If they want to play safe, recommend popular and consistent players.
Validation and Feedback Loop:

After each gameweek, compare the recommendations with actual performances. This feedback can be used to adjust the model.
Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations. This can be used to further refine the model.
Integration with Other Data Sources:

Integrate with other data sources like player heatmaps, touch maps, or expected goals (xG) and expected assists (xA) data. This can provide a deeper insight into a player's potential performance.
Visualization:

Provide visual insights like plots showing players' performance trends, team's fixture difficulty, or a player's heatmap.
Automation and Real-time Updates:

Automate data ingestion so that the recommendation engine updates in real-time or near-real-time as new data becomes available.
